title: OMOP Semantic Concept Registry
description: >
  Grouped registry structure for OMOP concept profiles used for
  complex semantic definitions, such as staging of neoplastic 
  disease through condition modifiers and their appropriate
  handling in episodes.

  Registry:

      A registry of OMOP concepts, templates, and groups used for complex semantic definitions.

  RegistryGroup:
    description: >
      Named grouping of semantic templates or definitions in the registry,
      used for organisation, documentation, and navigation. Members are
      registry symbols, not OMOP concept identifiers.

slots:
  registry_members:
    description: >
      List of registry symbols that are members of this group. These are not OMOP concept identifiers, 
      but rather references to other symbols in the registry, such as templates or groups. This is intended 
      for organisation and documentation purposes, and does not have any semantic meaning beyond indicating 
      that these symbols are related in some way.

    description: >
      List of registry groups contained in this registry. This is intended for organisation and documentation 
      purposes, and does not have any semantic meaning beyond indicating that these groups are part of the same 
      registry.

  fragments:
    range: RegistryFragment
    multivalued: true
    description: >
      List of registry fragments contained in this registry. This is intended for modularisation
      of units of semantic definitions, such as all concepts related to staging of neoplastic disease
      so that then can be reused in different registry profile definitions.
